# Guidelines

All shiny apps should be created in R packages according to the structure documented in [mastering-shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org)


# Project Setup
`shiny.quartz` includes several helpers to generate a shiny app.
These are included in the `utils` family of `shiny.quartz`.
They include `use_mod`, `use_app`, `use_dev`, and `use_run_app`.
