Quartz loves mui

A good shiny dashboard makes its best impact when powered by an elegant ui solution. Shiny.quartz builds on the [shiny.mui](https://quartzsoftwarellc.github.io/shiny.mui/) package to add more intuitive components.
## Installation 

```R
remotes::install_github("quartzsoftwarellc/shiny.quartz")
```

## Usage

All components that bear the same name as their shiny.mui parents have a Q prefix. For example QCard is a wrapper of the Card component.

Examples of the components can be found in the /inst/examples folder.
